## project in machine learning and data science
## contain from two mailston ( Regression and classification )
## In Rergression   
* in this mailston get data of players and get data preprossing and claeining data 
* the modeling by liner regression in regluiczATION norm one and norm two
* save models and get in predection section to predect only 
* and use the grad search cv to get the best params and models 
## In calssifivcation 
* in this mailston get data of players and get data preprossing and claeining data 
* the modeling by logistic and svm and desion tree and random forest and gussuanNG ....etc
* save models and get in predection section to predect only 
* and use the grad search cv to get the best params and models 

## from last get the docs to  explane project and presentation to show the steps of project
